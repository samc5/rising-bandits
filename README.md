# rising-bandits
DS592 final project; code for building a simple baseball dataset for bandit algorithms from Retrosheet pbp and biofile data, as well as implementation of it through code found in [Mussi et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07510)

## Launch Codes
- Run `data.py` after acquiring the relevant retrosheet data to generate the dataset
- Run `read.py` to run through an example of the successive rejection algorithm created by Mussi for Stochastic Rising Bandits
